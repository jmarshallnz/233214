## Potential ideas...

- It'd be nice to revisit kernel density estimation, using sparr, focus on denominator.

- It'd be nice to be able to model point process data using Kriging or interpolation techniques (inverse distance weighting, idw?, kriging?), need to introduce semivariograms etc?

Maybe also modelling point process using spatstat? ppm() with some covariates?

This models point location, not values at points.

- Then polygon based data, basically the idea behind conditional auto-regression?

This models counts of points in areas.
