This week we will continue working with point patterns, concentrating now on spatial interpolation with three related techniques:

 - [Inverse distance weighted interpolation](../notes/week12_idw.html).
 
 - [Simple Kriging](../notes/week12_simple_kriging.html).
 
 - [Universal Kriging](../notes/week12_universal_kriging.html).

You should utilise the material in the notes above and then work through the workshop sheet below (Right click -> Save link as, and load into RStudio):

[week12_workshop.Rmd](week12_workshop.Rmd)

Once you've worked through that, download the portfolio sheet below, work through and add answers, Knit to HTML and upload to the stream dropbox.
