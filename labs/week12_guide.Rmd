This week we will continue working with point patterns, concentrating now on spatial interpolation with three related techniques:

 - [Inverse distance weighted interpolation](../notes/week12_idw.html).
 
 - [Simple Kriging](../notes/week12_simple_kriging.html).
 
 - [Universal Kriging](../notes/week12_universal_kriging.html).

You should utilise the material in the notes above and then work through the workshop sheet below (Right click -> Save link as, and load into RStudio):

[week12_workshop.Rmd](week12_workshop.Rmd)

**There is no work to hand in as part of your portfolio this week.**
